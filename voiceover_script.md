# Self-Healing SRE Agent - Demo Video Voiceover Script

# Total Duration: 1 minute 45 seconds (105 seconds)

## [0:00 - 0:10] Introduction

"Welcome to the Self-Healing SRE Agent, an autonomous system powered by Gemini 3 Pro that detects, diagnoses, and fixes production errors without human intervention."

## [0:10 - 0:25] Dashboard Overview

"This is the agent's command center. On the left, you see the live production log stream. On the right, the five-step orchestration loop: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, and Verify."

## [0:25 - 0:35] Initializing the Agent

"Let's initialize the agent. It immediately begins monitoring the production environment, watching for error patterns in real-time."

## [0:35 - 0:50] Injecting a Failure

"Now, I'll inject a simulated failure into the system. Watch as database connection errors start flooding the logs. The agent detects the spike instantly."

## [0:50 - 1:10] Gemini 3 Analysis

"The agent now engages Gemini 3 Pro with high-level reasoning to analyze the error patterns. It identifies the root cause and generates a cryptographic Thought Signature, ensuring the diagnosis is verified before any action is taken."

## [1:10 - 1:25] Execution and Resolution

"Based on its analysis, the agent determines that a code revert is needed. It identifies the bad commit, applies the fix via Kubernetes, and verifies the system is stable again."

## [1:25 - 1:45] Conclusion

"The incident is now resolved. The agent produced a complete artifact including root cause analysis, the thought signature hash, and verification results. This is the future of Site Reliability Engineering: AI that doesn't just alert, but actually heals. Thank you for watching."
