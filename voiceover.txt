Welcome to the Self-Healing SRE Agent, an autonomous system powered by Gemini 3 Pro that detects, diagnoses, and fixes production errors without human intervention.

This is the agent's command center. On the left, you see the live production log stream. On the right, the five-step orchestration loop: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, and Verify.

Let's initialize the agent. It immediately begins monitoring the production environment, watching for error patterns in real-time.

Now, I'll inject a simulated failure into the system. Watch as database connection errors start flooding the logs. The agent detects the spike instantly.

The agent now engages Gemini 3 Pro with high-level reasoning to analyze the error patterns. It identifies the root cause and generates a cryptographic Thought Signature, ensuring the diagnosis is verified before any action is taken.

Based on its analysis, the agent determines that a code revert is needed. It identifies the bad commit, applies the fix via Kubernetes, and verifies the system is stable again.

The incident is now resolved. The agent produced a complete artifact including root cause analysis, the thought signature hash, and verification results. This is the future of Site Reliability Engineering: AI that doesn't just alert, but actually heals. Thank you for watching.
